						<h2 class="fragment">"Institutions that have been specifically designed to increase and deepen citizen participation in the political decision-making process."</h2>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Directly engage citizens (so excluding organised interest groups) </li>
							<li class="fragment">Institutionalised participation </li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">Beyond the (hyper) local level. </li>
								<li class="fragment">Beyond "traditional" institutionalised engagement, ie. elections and consultations. </li>
								<li class="fragment">Excluding informal participation (protests etc.) </li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">10 years (and a lot of research) later, a new definition suggested by Elstub and Escobar: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">"Processes or institutions...</li>
							<li class="fragment">...that are new to a policy issue, policy role, or level of governance, </li>
							<li class="fragment">...and developed to reimagine and deepen the role of citizens in governance processes</li>
							<li class="fragment">...by increasing opportunities for participation, deliberation and influence." </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">Questions for discussion: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">How does this definition differ from Graham Smith's? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Do you think this definition is an improvement? Why? Why not? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Is it too broad? Does it include too many things to still be meaningful? (concept stretching) </li>
							<li class="fragment">What do they have in common? </li>
						</ul>
					</section>

						<h3>Discussion</h3>
						<p class="fragment">So regardless of the definition we use, democratic innovations are about institutions that allow direct citizen involvement. </p>
						<p class="fragment">With this in mind, do you think... </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Democratic innovations could/should (have) be(en) used to determine societal responses to a pandemic?</li>

						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Democratic goods so broad that they need further interpretation to be useful. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Different goods can be at odds with each other, so we need normative framework to prioritise between them. </li>
							<li class="fragment">The very definition of democratic innovations is democratically normative, as well as each of Smith's "goods" (even if they are presented as general goods). </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">=> We need a theory of democracy to clearly specify our normative expectations of democratic innovations. </p>

							<ul class="fragment">
								<li style="font-style: italic">Main mechanism: Competetive elections for leaders. </li>
								<li style="font-style: italic">Reasoning: Ordinary people are not good decision makers, but elections provide an incentive for rulers to not become tyrannical. </li>

						<h2>First and second order analysis, and the practice of designing democracy </h2>

						<p class="fragment">“Design—the intentional creation of plans to solve a problem – is the key to understanding today’s and creating tomorrow’s democratic governance.” (p. xiv)</p>
						<h2>Question for discussion:</h2> 
						<ul class="fragment">
							<li>Who is the designer of democracy? </li>
							<li>Does it make sense to think of democracy as something that was intentionally designed to work in a certain way and meet certain goals? </li>
							<li>If we want to use democratic innovations in the face of a pandemic, who should design and implement these? </li>
							<li>Do you think the current pandemic could affect the opportunities for citizen involvement in our democracies? </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					
					
					<section>
						<h2>Discussion</h2>
						<ul class="fragment">
							<li>Is democracy – and should it be – a fixed concept?</li>
							<li>And what is the advantage/challenges of “allowing” many different conceptualisations of democracy? </li>
							<li>Does the concept of democracy lose it’s meaning if we do not have a shared understanding of what it mean? </li>
							<li>Do you see ways in which the current pandemic changes our democracies and opportunities to implement democratic innovations? </li>
							<li>Do you think democratic innovations could contribute to addressing the current pandemic? </li>
