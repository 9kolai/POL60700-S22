					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Theories of democracy: What should we expect from democratic innovations? </h3>
					<section>
						<h2>We need a definition of democracy</h2>
						<div class="fragment">
							<p>for two reasons: </p>
							<ol>
								<li>To clarify what we want democratic innovations to do. </li>
								<li>And to evaluate how well they meet those wishes. </li>
							</ol>
						</div>
						<p><span class="fragment">Democracy </span><span class="fragment">= demos (the people)</span><span class="fragment"> + kratos (rule) </span><span class="fragment">= "rule by the people" </span></p>
						<p class="fragment">But this is not very helpful without a clearer definiton of who the people are and how they are suppoosed to rule. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Democratic theory </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">A huge subject => We will only scratch the surface here. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Democratic theories are mostly normative. </li>
							<li class="fragment">The (main) point in this course is not to discuss the normative remits of different democratic theories. </li>
							<li class="fragment">But to use democratic theories as analytical frameworks. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Theories as different lenses to see the world through. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Main take-aways from this week </h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">We need to clearly define democracy to be able to evaluate democratic innovations. </li>
						<li class="fragment">Democracy is a contested concept that is defined in many different ways.  </li>
						<li class="fragment">We can use two different approaches to evaluate democratic innovations with theory:  </li>
						<ol class="fragment">
							<li>We can combine different theories to "combine the best from all". </li>
							<li>Democratic theory is needed to prioritise what is most important to democracy. </li>
						</ol>
					</ul>

					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Some examples of democratic theories </h3>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Minimal/Schumpeterian Democracy </li>
							<ul class="fragment">
								<li style="font-style: italic">Main mechanism: Competetive elections for leaders. </li>
								<li style="font-style: italic">Reasoning: Ordinary people are not good decision makers, but elections provide an incentive for rulers to not become tyrannical. </li>
								<li style="font-style: italic">Main propnents: Schumpeter (1942) </li>
							</ul>
							<li class="fragment">Deliberative Democracy </li>
							<ul class="fragment">
								<li style="font-style: italic">Main mechanism: The force of the better argument should determine political outcomes (rather than the majority) </li>
								<li style="font-style: italic">Reasoning: Under the right circumstances and conditions, all people are able to participate in reasoned debate, and agree on what is best for the common good. </li>
								<li style="font-style: italic">Some proponents: Jürgen Habermas, James Fishkin, John Dryzek, and many more. </li>
							</ul>
							<li class="fragment">Participatory Democracy </li>
							<ul class="fragment">
								<li style="font-style: italic">Main mechanism: Direct citizen participation in decision-making at all levels. </li>
								<li style="font-style: italic">Reasoning: Participation in politics is a good in itself, because it educates and empowers people. </li>
								<li style="font-style: italic">Main proponents: Carole Pateman, (Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Sherry Arnstein)</li>
							</ul>

						<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Taking an ecumenical approach: An analytical framework that can encompass all participatory institutions, ie. "democratic innovations" and democratic theories. </p>
						<ul class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">
							<li>Inclusiveness</li>
							<ul class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">
								<li style="font-style: italic">...the degree to which each person has an equal right to participate and have their voice heard. </li>

							<li>Considered judgement</li>

						<h3>Discussion: </h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">How easy or challenging do you think it is to apply these democratic goods to real cases of democratic innovations? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Which are the challenges of using this as an analytical framework? </li>
							<li class="fragment">Do you think it is a useful analytical framework? </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Ian O'Flynn's critiques of Smith's democratic goods: </h2>
						<p class="fragment">(As well as a general critique of ecumenical approaches)</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Democratic goods so broad that they need further interpretation to be useful. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Different goods can be at odds with each other, so we need normative framework to prioritise between them. </li>
							<li class="fragment">The very definition of democratic innovations is democratically normative, as well as each of Smith's "goods" (even if they are presented as general goods). </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">=> We need a theory of democracy to clearly specify our normative expectations of democratic innovations. </p>
